## Features

1. Voice Recognition: The system employs voice recognition to understand and process voice commands given by the user through a mobile app.

2. Syrup Extraction: The project automatically extracts syrup from a container based on the user's voice commands.

3. Mobile App Interface: A mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for sending voice commands to the system and monitoring the extraction process.

4. Arduino Integration: The system utilizes an Arduino board to control the extraction mechanism.

5. IoT Connectivity: It connects to the internet using IoT technology, allowing remote control and monitoring of the syrup extraction process.

## Requirements

To set up and run this project, you will need the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega)

- Microphone and speakers for voice input/output

- Internet connection

- Servo motor or pump for syrup extraction

- Container with syrup

- Mobile device (Android or iOS) with the voice assistance app installed

- Bluetooth module (if using Bluetooth connectivity between Arduino and mobile app)

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

- Required Arduino libraries (e.g., Servo library, Bluetooth library, etc.)

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Automatic Syrup Extractor project:

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.

2. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if not already installed.

3. Open the Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries for the project.

4. Connect the microphone and speakers to the Arduino board.

5. Connect the servo motor or pump to the Arduino board.

6. Ensure the container with syrup is properly connected to the extraction mechanism.

7. Configure the mobile app with the necessary settings (e.g., Bluetooth connection, IoT connectivity).

8. Upload the Arduino sketch provided with the project to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the Arduino board.

2. Launch the voice assistance app on your mobile device.

3. Connect to the Arduino board through the app (via Bluetooth or IoT connectivity).

4. Ensure the app is set up to communicate with the Automatic Syrup Extractor system.

5. Speak the voice commands through the mobile app to extract the desired amount of syrup.

6. The system will control the servo motor or pump to extract the syrup.

7. The extracted syrup will flow into a collection container or designated output area.

8. The app will provide feedback on the extraction status and confirmations.

9. The user can monitor the extraction process through the app's interface and receive updates remotely.
